# The 6 Pillars of the Hive AI

The **6 Pillars of the Hive AI** (Hive OS) are the core principles that define how the AI operating system works and stands apart.

## 1. Universal Token Economy
One subscription, one shared pool of tokens. Use them across every AI model, app, and connector—no need for multiple plans or logins.

## 2. Multi-Model AI Connections
Seamlessly access GPT, Claude, Gemini, and other models in one place, without losing your context or starting over every time.

## 3. Multi-App & Data Connections
Bring together your emails, docs, cloud storage, and business tools into a single conversational hub—no more scattered logins or siloed data.

## 4. The Hive Context Engine
Your conversations and history stay unified across models, apps, and devices—persistent memory that keeps track of what matters.

## 5. Natural Language Interface
Interact with all your apps and AI models simply by talking to them. No complex menus, just natural conversation.

## 6. Security First
Keeping people, families, and businesses safe and secure across all models, data, and devices is built into the core.
